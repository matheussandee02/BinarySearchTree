Project Description: Binary Search Tree for Brazilian Song Lyrics
This project involves the development of a Binary Search Tree (BST) that processes a text file containing Brazilian song lyrics. The application features a menu with the following options:

Load Text: Reads the song lyrics from a text file and constructs a Binary Search Tree.
Word Counter: Counts the total number of words in the song lyrics.
Search Word: Allows users to search for a specific word within the lyrics and returns its occurrence count.
Display Text: Outputs the entire song lyrics to the screen.
Letter Frequency: Analyzes and displays the frequency of each letter in the lyrics.
Exit Program: Terminates the application.
In addition to the Binary Search Tree, the project utilizes a HashMap and Map to efficiently manage and analyze the text data. The HashMap is employed to store and retrieve word frequencies, while the Map facilitates various operations related to the text analysis.

This project showcases the application of data structures and algorithms in processing and analyzing textual data, providing a user-friendly interface to interact with the song lyrics and extract meaningful information.
